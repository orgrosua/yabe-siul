Tailwind CSS for WordPress.

== Description ==

### Yabe Siul: the #1 Tailwind CSS plugin for WordPress.

Yabe Siul is a platform agnostic Tailwind CSS plugin for WordPress that allows you to use the full power of Tailwind CSS within the WordPress ecosystem.

### FEATURES

Yabe Siul is packed full of features designed to streamline your workflow. Some of our favorites are:

* **Customizable Configuration**: The plugin comes with a default Tailwind CSS configuration, but you can easily customize it to fit your needs.
* **Easy to use**: Simplified and intuitive settings to get you up and running quickly.
* **Lightweight and blazingly fast**: The plugin dashboard built on top of WordPress REST API, and a modern JavaScript framework for an instant, responsive user experience. It has a small footprint and won't slow down your site.
* **Compile on the browser. No server is required**: Generate the final CSS file in the browser without server-side tools. None of your data is transferred over the network.
